This Shiny application uses a marketing dataset with sales and advertising budgets for various media. The user selects which predictors to include (if any) in linear regression model and if any plots are desired.

How to use:

2. Select if a correlation plot of the selected predictors is desired
3. Select if a outlier and leverage plot of the fitted model is desired
4. View results

The `server.R` and `ui.R` files are in the `Sales` directory.
